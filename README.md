After working on this assignment, I came across 1 issue where when I would type in "do-what-it-says" in the command line to work with the random.txt file. I couldn't figure out why mine wouldn't work when I would include the quotation marks 

Ex: 
concert-this, do-what-it-says
"Astrothunder" (Won't Work)
Astrothunder (Working)

Overall, I do like this assignment a lot and working with the developer side of spotify helped me gain a better understanding of how intricate it is.
